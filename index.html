        <h3 id="what-evidence-is-there-that-the-S&P500-beats-active-managers">1. What Evidence is there that the S&P 500 index beats active managers?</h3>
            <p>Over its 23-year history, the SPIVA report shows that, on average, 64% of active large-cap fund managers fare worse than their benchmark (the S&P 500) in any given year. Some years feature truly dismal performances, such as in 2014 when 87% of analysts lagged behind the index. In 2023, “only” 60% underperformed, a result the SPIVA report deems “benign” considering the S&P 500’s reliance on a rather narrow set of stocks for its performance.</p>
            <p>Active managers who outperform the index one year tend to fall behind the next. After three years, only 20% of them outperformed the index. And this doesn’t even mean they do so in each one of those years; it rather means that their total return over the period exceeded the index, but it could have been lower in any one or two of those years. According to SPIVA, no manager stays in the top 25% of all managers, let alone outperform the index for 5 years in a row. Only just over 1% manage to stay in the top half. In essence, those demonstrating superior performance today are highly unlikely to replicate that success in the upcoming year.</p>

            <h3 id="what-is-an-index-fund">2. What is an index fund?</h3>
            <p>An index mutual fund or ETF (exchange-traded fund) tracks the performance of a specific market benchmark—or "index," like the popular S&P 500 Index—as closely as possible. That's why you may hear people refer to indexing as a "passive" investment strategy.</p>

<p>Instead of hand-selecting which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, the fund's manager buys all (or a representative sample) of the stocks or bonds in the index it tracks.</p>

        <p>John Bogle was an investor and founder of the Vanguard Group, one of the largest investment firms in the world.</p>
<p>Bogle created index investing, which allows investors to buy mutual funds that track the broader market.</p>
<p>Bogle introduced the Vanguard 500 fund, which tracks the returns of the S&P 500 and marked the first index fund marketed to retail investors.</p>
<p>One of Bogle's pioneering achievements was low-cost investing in mutual funds by creating no-load funds.</p>

         <h3 id="how-do-i-invest-in-an-index-fund">5. How do I invest in an index fund?</h3>
       
        <p><b><u>Pick an index</u></b></p>
        <p>There are hundreds of indexes you can track using index funds. The most popular index is the S&P 500 index, which includes 500 of the top companies in the U.S. stock market and is widely considered to be the best gauge of how the overall U.S. stock market is doing.</p>
        <p><b><u>Choose the right fund for your index</u></b></p>
        <p>Once you've chosen an index, you can generally find at least one index fund that tracks it. For popular indexes, like the S&P 500, you might have a dozen or more choices, all tracking the same index. If you have more than one fund option for your chosen index, you'll want to ask some basic questions.

<p>First, which index fund most closely tracks the performance of the index? An index fund's performance history is readily available on the issuer's website (for example, check Vanguard's website for performance data on its index funds).</p>

<p>Second, out of the top index funds that meet your needs, which index fund has the lowest costs? You can determine this by comparing the expense ratios of each index fund.</p>

<p>Third, are there any limitations or restrictions on an index fund that prevent you from investing in it? For example, many index funds in mutual fund form have minimum investment requirements.</p>

<p>And finally, does the fund provider have other index funds you're also interested in using? The answers to those questions should make it easier to pick the right index fund for you.</p>
       
        <p><b><u>Buy index fund shares</u></b></p>
       
        <p>You can open a brokerage account that allows you to buy and sell shares of the index fund that interests you. Index funds come in both exchange-traded fund (ETF) and mutual fund forms. Alternatively, you can typically open an account directly with a mutual fund company that offers an index fund you're interested in.</p>

<p>Again, it pays to look at costs and features when deciding the best way to buy shares of your index fund. Some brokers charge extra for their customers to buy index fund shares, making it cheaper to go directly through the index fund company to open a fund account.</p>

<p>That said, many investors prefer to have all their investments held in a single brokerage account. Plus, many brokers allow customers to buy fractional shares of index funds in exchange-traded fund (ETF) form. If you anticipate investing in several index funds offered by various fund managers, the brokerage option could be the best way to combine all your investments under a single account.</p>

        <h3 id="what-is-an-expense-ratio">6. What is an expense ratio?</h3>
       
        <p>An expense ratio is the cost of owning a mutual fund or ETF. Think of the expense ratio as the management fee paid to the fund company for the benefit of owning the fund.</p>
        <p>The expense ratio is measured as a percent of your investment in the fund. For example, a fund may charge 0.30 percent. That means you’ll pay $30 per year for every $10,000 you have invested in that fund.</p>

<p>You’ll pay this on an annual basis if you own the fund for the year. Don’t assume you can sell your fund just shy of a year and avoid the cost, however. For an ETF,  the management company will take the cost out of the fund’s net asset value daily behind the scenes, so it will be virtually invisible to you.</p>

<h3 id="is-the-s&p-500-the-best">7. Is the S&P 500 the best?</h3>



<p>The S&P 500 Index or Standard & Poor's 500 Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S. The index includes 503 components because three have two share classes listed.</p>

<p>It's not an exact list of the top 500 U.S. companies by market cap because the index includes other criteria. The S&P 500 index is nonetheless regarded as one of the best gauges of prominent American equities' performance and the stock market overall.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-the-s&p-500-the-best">8. Why is the S&P 500 the best?</h3>

<p>They're Easy To Invest In</p>

<p>When you buy individual stocks, there are a lot of different factors you need to look at. These include cash flow, debt, management, threats, and opportunities.</p>

<p>S&P 500 index funds don't require that kind of legwork because you're not putting a substantial amount of money into one specific company. Rather, you're buying a bucket of stocks that you're hoping will perform well over time.</p>

<p>This isn't to say that you shouldn't care about how stocks within the S&P 500 perform individually -- particularly those with larger market caps. But remember, if you own S&P 500 index funds and a single stock has a bad day, it may not have such a huge influence, given that it's one out of 500. And that takes the pressure off of you, as an investor.</p>

<p>They Lend To Diversity</p>

<p>It's important to maintain a diverse portfolio. Not only will that help shield you from losses, but it could also lead to more wealth accumulation through the years. The great thing about S&P 500 index funds is that they're super diverse because you're getting to own 500 different stocks with a single investment.</p>

<p>Let's imagine that instead of owning S&P 500 index funds, you decide to go heavy on tech stocks. If that sector tanks, your portfolio value might plummet. But while the S&P 500 definitely has its share of tech stocks, it also consists of stocks across a range of other industries.</p>

<p><i>(NOTE from the Author: When you own the S&P 500 you have a claim on virtually ALL of American Business from Now until Eternity. You also have a claim on ALL businesses that will one day be IN the S&P 500)</i></p>

<p><a rel="self" href="#questions">Back To Questions</a></p>


<h3 id="how-is-the-s&p500-index-fund-weighted">9. How is the S&P 500 index fund weighted?</h3>

<p>The S&P 500 index is weighted by market capitalization (share price times number of shares outstanding). This means that a company's valuation determines how much influence it has over the index's performance. Each listed company doesn't simply represent 1/500th of the index. Massive companies such as Apple (AAPL 1.88%) and Amazon (AMZN 0.73%) have a greater impact on the S&P 500 index than relatively smaller companies like General Motors (GM 2.92%).</p>

<p>One key point is that, although these are 500 large companies, there's a wide range of valuations. Several of the largest companies in the index have market caps in excess of $2 trillion. This is more than 200 times larger than the smallest S&P 500 companies, which have market caps in the $15 billion ballpark.</p>

<p>The value of the S&P 500 index continuously fluctuates throughout the trading day based on performance-weighted market data for the underlying companies.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-active-funds-beat-the-s&p-500">10. How many active funds beat the S&P 500?</h3>


<p>According to this data, there have only been three years since 2001 where a majority of active funds beat the S&P 500 index: 2005, 2007, and 2009.
This highlights the difficulty of beating the market, and why you should always do your research before investing in an actively-managed fund.</p>
<p>Referencing our past infographic which plotted 150 years of S&P 500 returns, we can see that 2005 and 2007 were both normal years for the index, logging a +4.9% and +5.5% gain respectively.</p>
<p>2009 was a relatively stronger year, with a +26.5% gain. A majority of active funds beat the index during this year due to the market volatility that followed the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>High volatility can create opportunities for skilled fund managers to pick undervalued stocks and adjust their portfolios quickly.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-warren-buffett">11. Who is Warren Buffett?</h3>

<p>Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of all time and has compounded his money at such a high rate that he’s now the 8th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $147 billion, according to Bloomberg.</p>

<p>"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund," Buffett had once said. "The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way," he further added.</p>

<p>"The record shows that the unmanaged index fund is going to do quite well over time and active investment as a group can't beat it," Buffett once said.</p>

<p>"The temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, well, maybe I should skip a year or something. Just keep buying," Buffett said during the 2017 annual shareholders meeting. "American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well."</p>

<p>Buffett wrote: “If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle.”</p>

<p>Buffett said. “He’s put tens, and tens, and tens, of billions into their pockets. And those numbers are going to be hundreds and hundreds of billions over time.”</p>

<p>He went on: “For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds. In his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who have promised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing – or, as in our bet, less than nothing – of added value."</p>

<p>"In his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment management industry. Today, however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their savings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.”</p>

<p>How Index Funds Stole Trillions From Wall Street</p>

<p> On average, each public fund hires 182 investment managers. In aggregate, these managers underperformed an equivalent mix of total market stock and bond index funds over the last 12 years by more than one and a half percentage points a year. For this failure, they have charged fees that have cost the average U.S. taxpayer $500 each year – a total of $68 billion annually.</p>

<p>Had they invested in index funds instead, the fees would have been less than a hundredth as much.</p>

<p>The S&P 500 is always changing and absorbing new members as they begin to grow market share and out perform. This swells the indexes performance. To continually beat this process you need to be consistently beating on winners, whereas the index just absorbs them. If you pick the best stock one year the next it could be the worst, the index doesn't have this problem. There are of course other factors, both financial, statistical and psychological.</p>

<p>Warren Buffett rips Wall Street for turning the stock market into ‘a gambling parlor’</p>

<p>“Wall Street makes money, one way or another, catching the crumbs that fall off the table of capitalism,” Buffett said. “They don’t make money unless people do things, and they get a piece of them. They make a lot more money when people are gambling than when they are investing.”</p>

<p>Warren Buffett has a long history of deriding investment bankers and their institutions –saying that they encourage mergers and spinoffs to reap fees, rather than improve companies.</p>

<p>He typically shuns investment bankers for his acquisitions, calling them pricey “money shufflers.” Buffett’s $848.02 per share offer for insurer Alleghany reportedly excludes Goldman’s advisory fee.</p>

<p>In a game of poker, the house takes a fee every single hand played. Each hand that is dealt at the table, the house takes a cut of the action. The house makes money by hosting the game while the player play each other. In a sense, the house owns the arena. Regardless of what happens, the house takes a small cut on each turn. These small cuts eventually add up to a huge amount. The house always wins. An index fund is a little bit like owning the house: you own everything.</p>

<h3 id="who-was-henry-singleton">32. Who was Henry Singleton?</h3>

<p>Historically, when you cast your mind to the great CEO's of our time, names like Jack Welch, Rupert Murdoch and Bill Gates are likely to be the first which come to mind, among others. The stark reality, however, is that a man by the name of Dr. Henry Singleton had a far superior operating and capital allocation record than all of those renowned managers. Sadly his legacy seems to have been lost in the annuls of modern business history.</p>

<p>Dr Henry Singleton was the founder and CEO of the American corporation, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (Teledyne), leading the company from 1960 until 1986. Teledyne was an industrial conglomerate, with interests as diverse as insurance, dental appliances, specialty metals and aerospace electronics.</p>

<p>Singleton was a rather eccentric character and did not fit the bill of a typical CEO. He was well educated and was an electrical engineer by trade, but was not the enigmatic visionary we have come to expect of today's corporate executives. Rather, he was quiet, extremely analytical and very thorough. He was also distrusting of the press and Wall Street and was reluctant to give into peer pressure to employ corporate policies or practices which did not align with his owner-oriented approach to management.</p>

<h3 id="what-was-henry-singletons-record">33. What was Henry Singleton's record?</h3>

<p>Singleton's record speaks for itself. During his reign, an initial investment of $450,000 morphed into a corporate behemoth. In 1981, the company delivered net income of $4.412 billion, having compounded annually at a rate of 19% between 1970-1981.</p>

<p>From 1966, Teledyne achieved an annual compounding return of 17.9% over 25 years, which amounted to a return on invested capital of 53 times. For comparisons sake, during the same period, the S&P 500 returned 6.7 times on invested capital and GE returned 9 times on invested capital.</p>

<p>It is little wonder that even Warren Buffett considers Singleton to have one of the finest operating and capital deployment records in American history</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-random-walk-down-wall-street">36. What is a Random Walk Down Wall Street?</h3>

<p>For investors, the random walk theory,  popularized by Princeton University Economics Professor Burton Malkiel in his book “A Random Walk Down Wall Street,” maintains that a share price, which is the variable, moves seemingly at random, akin to how a drunk person might walk down the street. It doesn’t have any known relationship with historic values or other variables, nor does it have any identified pattern. However, the theory does not exclude the possibility that a share price’s movement conforms to a pattern or has a relationship to other factors.</p>

<p>The theory is often borne out in the short term. Active fund managers rarely outperform the market, and the number who do appears to be shrinking as computer technology makes markets ever more efficient. This supports the theory’s core premise that picking individual stocks and short-term investing tends to generate risk disproportionate to reward.</p>

<p>In the long term, however, the theory loses credibility. The success of long-term investing highlights the essential limitation of random walk theory: stock prices do follow a trend toward predictable outcomes. If stock prices moved in an entirely random fashion, the history of the stock market would look like a scatter plot without pattern. Indices like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average would be as likely to move down as up in any given year, and the market overall would trend toward net-zero gains and losses over time. This is observably untrue.</p>

<p>Random walk theory says it’s impossible to predict how a stock will move at any given time. In the short- and mid-term, a stock’s price doesn’t have any known relationship with either its historic value or the value of any other assets on the market. The lack of any known pattern means that standard investing tools like market timing and technical or fundamental analysis don’t work.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-downsides-of-investing-in-index-funds">37. What are the downsides of investing in index funds?</h3>

<p>While index funds offer many benefits, it’s important to note that they’re not perfect. One of the potential downsides of investing in an index fund is the lack of control over the underlying investments. Because index funds are designed to track a particular market index, investors don’t have a say in which individual stocks or bonds the fund holds.</p>

<p>Another potential downside is the possibility of underperformance during market downturns. While index funds aim to track the performance of the underlying index, they can still experience losses during market downturns.</p>

<p>Finally, while index funds offer diversification benefits, they’re not immune to market risk. In a market downturn, all stocks in the index will likely experience losses, including those held in the index fund.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-spiva">38. What is SPIVA?</h3>

<p>S&P Indices versus Active (SPIVA) scorecards are semiannual reports
published by S&P Dow Jones Indices that compare the performance of
active equity and fixed income mutual funds against their benchmarks over
different time horizons. The inaugural scorecard was published in 2002
and focused on the U.S., and has since been extended to Australia,
Canada, Europe, India, Japan, Latin America, South Africa, and the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA).</p>

<h3 id="why-does-the-active-vs-passive-debate-matter">39. Why does the active vs passive debate matter?</h3>

<p>The premise of active management is essentially that with enough skill, it’s easy to consistently outperform the market, or the benchmark. When this view was challenged decades ago, it sparked a longstanding debate with strong believers on both sides, and some in between.</p>

<p>The impact of the debate is far-reaching. It informs decisions about whether to use an active manager or invest in an index-based fund such as an ETF. It challenges the notion that alpha is what all investors should strive for. It has also created a need to gauge the suitability of both approaches across a range of time periods and asset classes.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-spiva-tell-us">40. What does SPIVA tell us?</h3>

<p>While no two SPIVA Scorecards are exactly the same, certain themes have emerged over time. One is that actively managed funds have historically tended to underperform their benchmarks over short- and long-term periods. This has tended to hold true (with exceptions) across countries and regions. Another recurring theme is that even when a majority of actively managed funds in a category have outperformed the benchmark over one time period, they have usually failed to outperform over multiple periods.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-so-hard-to-win-with-active-management">41. Why is it so hard to win with active management?</h3>

<p>SPIVA research tells us that relatively few active managers are able to outperform passive managers over any given time period, either short-term or long-term. But the true measure of successful active management is whether a manager or strategy can deliver above-average returns consistently over multiple periods. Demonstrating the ability to outperform repeatedly is the only proven way to differentiate a manager's skill from luck. Through research published in our Persistence Scorecards, we show that relatively few funds can consistently stay at the top.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-bonds">42. What are bonds?</h3>

<p>A bond is a fixed-income instrument and investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a certain interest rate for an amount of time. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond.</p>

<p>Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.</p>

<h3 id="are-there-index-funds-for-bonds">43. Are there index funds for bonds?</h3>

<p>Yes, there are index funds for bonds, which are designed to match the performance of a large group of bonds:
<p>Bond Index Fund: A passively managed fund that aims to replicate the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index. It invests in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, including government, agency, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund: A fund that holds over 10,000 domestic investment-grade bonds.
Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund: A fund that holds around 7,000 bonds from developed and emerging non-U.S. markets.</p>
<p>Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund: A bond index fund from Fidelity Investments.</p>

<p>Bond index funds can be a good option for slow and steady growth. They can also provide income and stability during market downturns. However, the value of a bond fund can change based on interest rates. When interest rates rise, the value of the fund will drop, and vice versa. It's generally recommended to own bond index funds for the long term to help weather short-term volatility.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-futures">44. What are futures?</h3>

<p>Futures are contracts to buy or sell a specific underlying asset at a future date. The underlying asset can be a commodity, a security, or other financial instrument. Futures trading requires the buyer to purchase or the seller to sell the underlying asset at the set price, whatever the market price, at the expiration date.</p>

<p>Futures trading commonly refers to futures whose underlying assets are securities in the stock market. These contracts are based on the future value of an individual company's shares or a stock market index like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Nasdaq.</p>

<p>Futures trading on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange can include underlying "assets" like physical commodities, bonds, or weather events.</p>

<h3 id="are-there-index-funds-for-futures">45. Are there index funds for futures?</h3>

<p>Yes, some index funds may use derivatives like futures to help achieve their investment goals. Portfolio managers may use equity index futures to "equitize" cash balances in their portfolio. This gives the cash index exposure until the contract expires</p>

<h3 id="what-are-options">46. What are options?</h3>

<p>Options are versatile financial products. These contracts involve a buyer and seller, where the buyer pays a premium for the rights granted by the contract. Call options allow the holder to buy the asset at a stated price within a specific time frame. Put options, on the other hand, allow the holder to sell the asset at a stated price within a specific time frame. Each call option has a bullish buyer and a bearish seller while put options have a bearish buyer and a bullish seller.</p>

<p>Traders and investors buy and sell options for several reasons. Options speculation allows a trader to hold a leveraged position in an asset at a lower cost than buying shares of the asset. Investors use options to hedge or reduce the risk exposure of their portfolios.</p>

<p>(No.) Index options can be used to protect your portfolio from market downturns. For example, if you own a broad stock portfolio, you could buy put options on a corresponding index. If the market falls, the value of your put options will rise, offsetting some of your portfolio losses.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-commodities">48. What are commodities?</h3>

<p>Commodities are raw materials used to create the products consumers buy, from food to furniture, to gasoline or petrol. Commodities include agricultural products such as wheat and cattle, energy products such as oil and natural gas, and metals such as gold, silver, and aluminum. There are also “soft” commodities, which cannot be stored for lengthy periods, including sugar, cotton, cocoa, and coffee.</p>

<p>The commodity market has evolved significantly from the days when farmers hauled bushels of wheat and corn to the local market. In the 1800s, demand for standardized contracts for trading agricultural products led to the development of commodity futures exchanges. Today, futures and options contracts can be traded on exchanges around the world on a huge array of agricultural products, metals, energy products and soft commodities. These standardized contracts enable commodity producers to offload their price risk to end users and other financial market participants.</p>

<p>Commodities have also evolved as an asset class since the 1990s, with the development of commodity futures indexes and subsequently, investment vehicles that benchmark against these indices. Today investors can choose from a variety of vehicles for investing in the commodities futures markets, from mutual funds to exchange-traded funds or notes, covering the wide spectrum from single commodity exposures to sector based and broad-based commodity exposures.</p>

<h3 id="are-there-index-funds-for-commodities">49. Are there index funds for commodities?</h3>

<p>There are many different types of commodity funds, including:</p>

<p>Index funds. These funds track an index that includes various commodity assets.</p>
<p>Commodity funds. Known as "true" commodity funds, these funds invest directly in the underlying commodity asset. An example would be a commodity fund that holds a direct position in gold and oil.</p>
<p>Futures-based commodity funds. These funds offer exposure to commodities through investing in futures contracts, without ever buying the actual commodity assets themselves. This type of investment can carry higher risk, due to the volatile nature of the futures contracts market.</p>

<h3 id="where-are-index-funds-traded">50. Where are index funds traded?</h3>

<p>(NOTE from Author: There are 2 types of index funds: Mutual funds and ETFs. Mutual Funds are not traded on an exchange. ETFs are.)</p>

<p>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like an individual stock. ETFs can be structured to track anything from the price of a commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities.</p>

<p>ETFs can even be designed to track specific investment strategies. Various types of ETFs are available to investors for income generation, speculation, and price increases, and to hedge or partly offset risk in an investor’s portfolio. The first ETF was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index.</p>

<p>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock does.</p>

<p>ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds, which only trade once a day after the market closes.</p>

<p>ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually.</p>
